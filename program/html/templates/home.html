            grid of text editable by any visitor. The changes made by other people
            appear on your screen as they happen. Everyone starts in the same place, but
            you can scroll through the world using your mouse.

        <p>
            Put any letters at the end of the URL to go to a new world. For
            example, <a href="/forexample">http://yoursitehere.com/forexample</a>.
            They all start off blank. You can also <a href="{{ url_profile }}">create a custom
            world</a> for you and your friends.
